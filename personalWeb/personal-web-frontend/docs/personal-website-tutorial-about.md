# Abstract
Using **Azure Virtual Machine in Linux** and **Github** build a personal website. 

**Payments needed:**
* Domain name
* SSL certificate (Optional)
* Azure Virtual Machine in Linux (if not a student)

This blog will be divided into different sections, allowing you to easily **check any missed steps**, **discover areas** you need to understand, or **follow my mind from the beginning.**

**Why Azure ?**

This presents an excellent opportunity for students in 
**mainland China** to create their own websites that are accessible from 
**anywhere around the world!** Such guidance is ***scarce in China***, so it's a 
chance to explore on your own. Microsoft provides a virtual machine 
with a cloud server located in *East Asia*, specifically in **Hong Kong.** 
This location ensures minimal network delays, 
and you do not need to worry about obtaining an 
*ICP Record number* or completing any *filing procedures*, etc. 
Additionally, you can use this VM to access ***ChatGPT*** and many other services!
## Crucial steps
